# Movie-Analysis
In this project, we will use our skills to study some information about movies on Netflix.

First, we'll organize data into lists. Then, we'll look at data from a longer time, using a .csv file with Netflix information. We want to see if the average length of movies on Netflix has changed.
Let's then create a data frame from the dictionary. To convert our dictionary movie_dict to a pandas DataFrame, we will first need to import the library under its usual alias. We'll also want to inspect our DataFrame to ensure it was created correctly. Let's perform these steps now. Let's do a visual inspection of our data; 

Given that the data is continuous, a line plot would be a good choice, with the dates represented along the x-axis and the average length in minutes along the y-axis. This will allow us to spot any trends in movie durations easily. There are many ways to visualize data in Python, but matploblib.pyplot is one of the most common packages to do so.

In the end, we can have an idea about why we could perceive that movies are getting shorter.
